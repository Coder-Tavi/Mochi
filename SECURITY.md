## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability within the project, locate your type of vulnerability and then follow the steps.
### Dependencies
If the vulnerability has not been flagged by Snyk, Dependabot, or another user (who has followed these steps) when you discover the vulnerability, follow these steps:
1. Update, lock, or downgrade the packages to a safe version that does not introduce breaking changes to the project.
2. If breaking changes must be introduced, **state so in the PR**.

### Code
1. Open an issue and state what effect the vulnerability has on the project
2. If you know how to resolve the vulnerability, you can open a pull request and fix the issue there (**You must add "fixes #\<issue number>" so GitHub will link the issue and pull request**)

### Other
1. Contact one of the authors via [Discord](https://discord.gg/UKRGd2KqzK) and state what the issue is **in direct messages**. They will advise you with the best course of action.
